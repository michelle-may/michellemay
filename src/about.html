  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  <p class="h4">I'm Michelle, a UX designer and developer originally from London but now based in Manchester.</p>

  <p>My love of the internet started early when I began making websites at 11, using the HTML and CSS I learned via Lissa Explains Explains It All and putting it into practice on my Neopets' pet pages. This skill manifested in lots of outputs over my teenage years (Geocities fan sites, Myspace themes, personal blogs) and eventually I graduated with a degree in Interactive Digital Media in 2012. I've honed my skills in agencies and through freelancing since and have worked across a wide range of industries including e-commerce, healthcare and telecom consultancy.</p>
  <p>I have a keen eye for detail, and a drive to do things the right way. I like to understand the big picture and how everything connects. I'm pragmatic and **something else.** </p>
  <p><strong>Currently</strong> I'm a lead UX designer, line manager and accessibility champion at <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/">Co-op Digital</a>. My day-to-day is within the Funeralcare business, working to help the business become more data-informed and user-centred. I still use my coding skills, but these days more focused on rapid prototyping and building close designer-developer relationships. </p>
  <p>I love memes, dogs, plants and baking.</p>
  <p>Outside of work, I'm a big foodie and love to go to restaurants. I also enjoy escaping into nature for hikes, as well as playing video games.</p>
